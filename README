  ASQL is a simple tool to allow you to query Apache common logfiles
 via SQL.

  Why might you want to do this?  Well it does allow you to make certain 
 queries very easily, for example:


  Greediest IPs:

  SELECT source,SUM(size) AS Number FROM logs GROUP BY source ORDER BY Number DESC, ip

  A count of referers:
 
  SELECT referer,COUNT(referer) AS number from logs WHERE referer NOT LIKE '%steve.org.uk%' GROUP BY referer ORDER BY number DESC,referer LIMIT 0,5
