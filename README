asql
----

  ASQL is a simple tool to allow you to query Apache common logfiles
 via SQL. (Only "Apache common" logfiles are currently supported.)

  When asql starts up it creates a temporary SQLite database to hold
 the contents of the parsed logfile(s) you might load.  This temporary
 database may then be queried directly via SQL.

  Why might you want to do this?  Well it does allow you to make certain
 queries very easily.


Aliases
-------

  Using the 'alias' command you may record and replay previous
 queries by name.

  For example the following query will show the number of hits
 against your server:

   SELECT COUNT(id) FROM logs;

  You could save this query via this:

   ALIAS hits SELECT COUNT(id) FROM logs;

  Now at any future point entering 'hits' would run the query.

  (Aliases persist between sessions via the file ~/.asql.aliases.)


Example Queries
---------------

  The following examples give an idea of the kind of power an SQL
 query allows you:


  Greediest downloaders:

  SELECT source,SUM(size) AS Number FROM logs GROUP BY source ORDER BY Number DESC, source

  A count of each distinct referers:

  SELECT referer,COUNT(referer) AS number from logs WHERE referer NOT LIKE '%steve.org.uk%' GROUP BY referer ORDER BY number DESC,referer LIMIT 0,10


  See which Debian packages were downloaded the most:

  SELECT request,COUNT(request) AS Number FROM logs WHERE request LIKE '%.deb' GROUP BY request ORDER BY Number DESC, request;


  See who has downloaded me:

   select * FROM logs WHERE request='/etch/pool/main/a/asql/asql_0.6-1_all.deb';
