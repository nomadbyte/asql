----

  ASQL is a simple tool to allow you to query Apache common logfiles
 via SQL.  When it starts up it creates a temporary SQLite database
 which later you may load Apache logfiles to.

  Once you've loaded files you may then query against the temporary
 database.

  Why might you want to do this?  Well it does allow you to make certain 
 queries very easily, for example:


Examples
--------

  Greediest downloaders:

  SELECT source,SUM(size) AS Number FROM logs GROUP BY source ORDER BY Number DESC, ip

  A count of each distinct referers:
 
  SELECT referer,COUNT(referer) AS number from logs WHERE referer NOT LIKE '%steve.org.uk%' GROUP BY referer ORDER BY number DESC,referer LIMIT 0,10


  See which .deb files were downloaded the most:

  SELECT request,COUNT(request) AS Number FROM logs WHERE request LIKE '%.deb' GROUP BY request ORDER BY Number DESC, request;


  See who has downloaded me:

   select * FROM logs WHERE request='/etch/pool/main/a/asql/asql_0.1-2_all.deb';
